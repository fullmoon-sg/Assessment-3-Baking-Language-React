            <p>Since I have the rare opportunity to use the PC and to update my blog now, I should just finished up my draft for the Thai Milk Tea Ogura which I baked last August (#^^#) Yes,
            it has been that long. If not for the Thai Milk Tea Chiffon Cake post, hehehe â€¦. I might still be procrastinating and whining about my own backlog.
            </p>

                Baked this ogura last Aug cos wanted to try my fav beverage flavor into my bakes. Got myself a tin of the Thai Milk Tea mix last June, already with the intention then to bake
                some cakes or cookies in this flavor ^^ So happy that the ogura turned out well.
            </p>

                I used a 7 inch round tin. I did not grease the pan but only lined the bottom with parchment paper. You would need another big pan for the water bath baking method.

                <ul>
                    <li>1 whole egg</li>
                    <li>5 egg yolks</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>60g salad oil/corn oil</li>
                    <li>70ml Thai Milk Tea (*I made the tea by adding 2 teaspoons of the leaves to 70ml boiling water. Leave to steep for 10 min. Strain the leaves away. Add 1
                    tablespoon of condensed milk to the tea. Adjust sweetness to your preference. Leave to cool.)</li>
                    <li>20g evaporated milk</li>
                    <li>75g cake flour</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>5 egg whites</li>
                    <li>45g caster sugar</li>

                 Method : 
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Beat the egg yolk, whole egg, salt, oil, Thai milk tea and evaporated milk together until fluffy. Put all the other ingredients in (A) into the mixer 
                        and slowly added in the cooled milk tea.</li>
                    <li>Shift in the flour and stir well. Put aside.</li>
                    <li>In another clean and dry mixer, beat egg white and lemon juice till foamy. Add in sugar slowly while mixer is still running. Continue whisking till 
                        firm peaks.</li>
                    <li>Take 1/3 of the egg white batter and add into the egg yolk batter. Using a hand whisk, mix well. Then slowly add in another 1/3 to the batter. This time, 
                        switch to a spatula and fold in the mixture. Repeat with the remaining egg white batter and fold into the egg yolk batter. Fold well but gently so as not 
                        to deflate the batter. Try not to overfold the batter as well.</li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture into the pan. Knock the pan gently on the kitchen top to release any air bubbles. Do this about 2-3 times. Place this pan into the large 
                        pan. Add in hot water to the larger pan till about 1/3 full.</li>
                    <li>Bake in preheated oven at 160 degree celsius for about 30min. Then reduce the temperature to 150 degree celsius and bake for another 30min approximately.</li>
                    <li>Once baked, open the oven door slowly. Take out the pan and remove cake immediately from pan. Invert the cake on a cooling rack and let cool completely. 
                        Once cooled, the cake is ready to be sliced and served.</li>
                </ol>
